# Movie Rating
This python scripts retrieves the rating of a movie given its title.

The following web sites can be used to retreive the rating of movies:

- IMDB 
- RogerEbert 
- Metacritic

Currently only IMDB is supported but the support for the rest will be added soon.

**Usage:**  
An example file has been added to indicate how to use the script. Usage:  

> python example.py {MOVIE_NAME}  

Example:  
 	
> python example.py 'A Separation'

You can also specify the movie's production year, like:  
> python example.py 'Shawshank Redemption 1994'
